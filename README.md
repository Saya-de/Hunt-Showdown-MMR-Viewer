# Hunt-Showdown-MMR-Viewer
This is a forms tool window i made some time ago to see the exact Hunt Showdown MMR Number. It reads the attributes.xml from your Hunt Showdown files and uses System.XML to get the stuff we actually need.

I wont put a release in there, you need to change to values "steamname" and "huntfolder" yourself and compile it.
